# Jam-Text

A high-performance text indexer using SimHash fingerprints for text similarity search. Written in Go, it provides efficient indexing and searching of large text files through vector similarity with random hyperplanes.

## Current Status

âœ… Implemented:
- Parallel chunk processing architecture
- SimHash core implementation with LSH support
- Dual vectorization methods (frequency and n-gram based)
- Worker pool for concurrent processing
- Parallel hyperplane generation
- Basic CLI framework
- Basic project structure
- Hamming distance similarity comparison
- Thread-safe random number generation
- Content moderation with configurable word lists

ðŸš§ In Progress:
- Index command implementation
- Lookup command implementation
- Index storage serialization
- Full CLI functionality
- Additional vectorization methods
- Performance optimization for large datasets

## Core Components

### SimHash Implementation
- 128-dimensional vector space
- 64-bit fingerprints
- Parallel hyperplane generation using Box-Muller transform
- Normalized random hyperplanes
- Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) support
- Configurable band signatures for fast similarity search
- Two vectorization strategies:
  - Frequency-based: Uses word frequencies with MD5 dimension mapping
  - N-gram based: Uses character n-grams with normalized vectors

### Chunk Processing
- Default chunk size: 4KB
- Configurable overlap: 256 bytes
- Boundary-aware splitting
- Metadata support per chunk
- Parallel processing via worker pool

### Worker Pool
- Context-based graceful shutdown
- Buffered task channels
- Dynamic worker scaling
- Concurrent task processing

## Usage

```bash
# Index a file (in development)
jamtext -cmd index -i <input_file> -o <output_file>

# Lookup similar text (in development)
jamtext -cmd lookup -i <input_file> -o <output_file>

# Moderate content for offensive language
jamtext -cmd moderate -i <input_file> [-wordlist words.txt] [-level strict|lenient] [-context 50] [-v]
```

## Building

Requirements:
- Go 1.24.1 or higher
- Make (optional)
